# Car-Battery-Charging-Circuit
This simple circuit for charging car batteries is interesting due to its behavior, which can be defined as similar to that of the alternator regulator mounted in cars.

It is capable of charging the battery up to the chosen voltage (normally 13.8 V) and maintaining it constantly without the risk of overcharging.

Its power is not limited to the scheme described, which represents the most convenient and recommended solution, but it also works in smaller dimensions, albeit taking longer, or in larger dimensions with better results.
